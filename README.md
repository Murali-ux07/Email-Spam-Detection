📧 Spam Detection Project

This project is a machine learning-based spam detection system implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It classifies text messages as **spam** or **not spam** using common preprocessing techniques and a trained classifier.

🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess a dataset of SMS messages
- Vectorize the text using techniques like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF
- Train a machine learning model to classify messages
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics

🧠 Techniques Used

- Text cleaning & normalization
- Tokenization
- Vectorization: CountVectorizer / TF-IDF
- Machine Learning: Naive Bayes / SVM / Logistic Regression
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

📊 Dataset
